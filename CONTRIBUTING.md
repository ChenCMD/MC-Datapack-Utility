## Localization

MC Datapack Utility supports multiple languages.
MCDU would be much better if you could translate this project into your language.

We are using the [SPGoding](https://github.com/SPGoding) website together for translation.

#### Steps
1. Go to the [localization website](https://l10n.spgoding.com/).
1. [Register](https://l10n.spgoding.com/accounts/register) by linking your GitHub account (recommended), or using your email.
    - Note that the username and email will be shown in the repository's git commit log. If you don't feel like you want to disclose your own email address, feel free to [contact SPGoding](https://github.com/SPGoding/datapack-language-server/wiki/Contact-SPGoding) to get an account with a fake email address.
1. See two components of MCDU [here](https://l10n.spgoding.com/projects/mc-datapack-utility).
1. Start translating!

#### Note
- If your language is not listed on the platform, simply contact [ChenCMD](https://github.com/ChenCMD/MC-Datapack-Utility/wiki/Contact);
- If you have suggestions for the source string (en-us), please [open an issue](https://github.com/ChenCMD/MC-Datapack-Utility/issues/new).
